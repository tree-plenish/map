Issues:
- website header gets squashed for smaller window sizes --> gotta fix the html and css for this because it's messy
Next steps:
- put school-specific data on their pages
- add a main analytics page w aggregate data from all schools
- progress bars
- error for when school can't be found in flask
    -aka just go to blank page?
